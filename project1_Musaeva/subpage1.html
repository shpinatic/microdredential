    <li ><h1>Diving</h1>
      <p> Whetheryou're an experienced diver or have never taken an underwater breath, you'll love the aquatic wonderland of Queensland. It's a kaleidoscope of reefs, shoals and coral cays teeming with tropical marine life. The Great Barrier Reef, which extends along Queensland’s coastline for more than 2,000km (1,200mi), is the largest expanse of living coral on the planet. There are so many epic spots to see; here are just a few of the best places to dive on the Great Barrier Reef. </p>
      <p>Agincourt Reef is located at the Great Barrier Reef’s northern end, near Cairns. This is a great spot even for beginner divers. Here, you can snorkel or dive on the edge of the continental shelf with an abundance of technicoloured fish, sea turtles and even reef sharks. Discover the breathtaking Blue Wonder wall, where the coral garden drops vertically for more than 40m (131ft).Cairns and Port Douglas are both great places to base yourself to dive Agincourt Reef. Most tours depart from Port Douglas, but it’s possible to arrange pick-up from your Cairns accommodation.</p>
      <p>Why wander through a regular museum when you can swim among the artworks at The Museum of Underwater Art (MOUA)? Descend into an awe-inspiring underwater world with a visit to MOUA’s Coral Greenhouse sculpture at John Brewer Reef, off the coast of Townsville, which features a 9m (30ft) stainless steel greenhouse structure designed to dissipate the ocean's undercurrents. While it can be viewed with a snorkel, it's best experienced as a dive for a thorough exploration of all its beautiful details. There are many dive tour operators like ProDive Magnetic Island that will take you to explore this phenomenal under-the-sea art exhibit.</p>

    <p>See the highlights of the Whitsundays, including Whitehaven Beach and iconic Heart Reef, from above as you fly over them in a scenic helicopter or seaplane flight. Have your camera ready so you can capture all the spectacular sights.</p>
    <p>Whitehaven Beach is a seven-kilometre (4.3-mile) stretch of pure white silica sand, with Hill Inlet at one end. Tourists come from all over the world to marvel at its beauty. It's in the same area as the Great Barrier Reef's Heart Reef, a beautiful coral arrangement in the shape of a heart. You'll see them both on a half-day adventure with Air Whitsunday. You'll take off in a seaplane from Airlie Beach, soaring over the Whitsunday Islands and circling over Heart Reef for photos before landing on the water at a nearby coral lagoon. Here you will jump from the plane into the water and snorkel the Great Barrier Reef before taking off again and flying to picturesque Whitehaven Beach for a champagne lunch. After lunch you'll be returned to your accommodation. </p>
